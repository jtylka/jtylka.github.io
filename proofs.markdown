			<a href="../Documents/Proofs/shaded-circle-region.pdf" target="_blank">Circular Lens Intersection Problem</a>
		</h3><p>
			I came across this math problem on <a href="https://youtu.be/cPNdvdYn05c" target="_blank">YouTube</a> (see below), and took a stab at solving it.
			After viewing the associated <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3016718/726280" target="_blank">StackExchange</a> post, I decided the answers there were missing an analytical expression, so I solve for it here.
			In its most compact form, the solution is \((3 \theta - 1) x^2\), where \(L = 2x\) and \(\theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{1}{2}\).

			<a href="../Documents/Proofs/impulse-train-identity.pdf" target="_blank">Fourier Transform Identity for an Infinite Impulse Train</a>
		</h3><p>
			This is a classic signal processing problem / Fourier transform identity.
			Turns out the Fourier transform of an infinite Dirac delta impulse train is another infinite Dirac delta impulse train.

			<a href="../Documents/Proofs/residues-change-of-variables.pdf" target="_blank">Residues of Complex Functions Under a Linear Translation</a>
		</h3><p>
			I wrote this proof to get some points back on a math exam in grad school.
			To me it was obvious (at the time) - residues of a complex-valued function remain constant under a linear translation.
			I prove this, and apply it to simplify the process of computing an inverse Laplace transform via the Bromwich integral.
